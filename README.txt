I have implemented this project using Java Springboot, Angular with H2 Database.

CountryCRUD-Angular-Springboot-H2
	crud - Backend implementation with Springboot
	usercrud - Frondend development with Angular

For styling I have used Amgular Material but at somepoints I had to use Bootsrap with JQuery as well.
It is becuase I am not fully equiped with Angular Material and I'm hoping to sharp that styling knowledge as well.
Other dependencies are normal ones used for Angular Projects. 

CRUD is completed. A user can update the fields with overloading the data using the country number.
A screenshot of my output with some demo data, has been added in the repo as well. Thank you!
